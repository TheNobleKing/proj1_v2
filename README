Project 1 of CISC 450

TCP/IP server-client connection, programmed in C. The goal of this project is to design a program which utilizes
internet sockets to send a file over the internet.

server.c / server.o
client.c / client.o
send.txt
recv.txt
makefile
frost.txt
island.txt
out.txt
README <- (this file)

uses:

make all
- compile server / client code

make server
- Executes server.o 

make client
- Executes client.o

make run
- Executes server and client concurrently

make clean
- remove .o files (used for execution)
- cleans up directory

INSTRUCTIONS:
Open two bash windows, as keyboard input to client is required.
If directory needs to be cleaned, run $make clean.
To run program, run the following code:
>$make all
>$make server
(in a different window:)
>$make client
input filename to request. Available demo texts are island.txt, frost.txt, test.txt
Program handles the rest and outputs out.txt
